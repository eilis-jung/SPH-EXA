# Pre-requisites

The visualization part is implemented with Vulkan. A Vulkan-compatible graphics driver is needed to run it.

For development, you need the following packages installed (in Ubuntu 22.04):

1. Vulkan SDK (see [here](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/doc/view/latest/linux/getting_started_ubuntu.html) for instructions)

2. 

```
apt install libglfw3-dev libglew-dev libxinerama-dev libxcursor-dev libxi-dev
```
